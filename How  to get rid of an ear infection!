HI!!!! So the craziest things going on today! Well, my ear is killing me and I know that im probally not the only one who got NO SLEEP!!! 
Well here is some of my ear infection tips:
First off, What I do is try not to talk or cry, because it only makes it worse.
Secondly,eat, but don't eat a lot because chewing  makes the jaw move, and when the jaw moves your ears hurt!
If it does'nt make your ears pop, eat some soup and stay hydrated.
You might want to ask your local docter about ear tubes, if your infections keep coming back.
And finally, t5ake some medicne (ear drops, tylanol, ect.)
REMEMBER:
I AM NOT A DOCTER. I JUST ALWAYS  HAVE TERRIBLE EAR INFECTIONS! THIS STUFF WORKS FOR ME SO I HOPE IT WILL WORK FOR YOU.
(oh and if you dont take avice from 10 year old girls, this article is not for you)
